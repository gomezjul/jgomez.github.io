        Bike riding is not just a hobby; it's an important part of my identity. From my early days as a kid, I fell and crashed countless times, I collided with poles in my pursuit of racing against imaginary friends. Now, as an adult, I ride as time permits. My name is Adrian Gonzalez, a 42-year-old with a lifelong passion for cycling.

        Throughout my professional journey, I have been entrenched in the world of banking, dedicating my entire career to this industry. Armed with a bachelor's degree in accounting, I have refined my skills in numbers and analysis, allowing me to uncover details that may elude others. I find great satisfaction in working with financial data and unraveling the stories hidden within.

        However, beyond my professional pursuits, my true joy lies in my family. With two wonderful boys and a loving wife who has been by my side for over two decades, my happiness is rooted in the bonds we share. I involve in activities that reflect my dedication as a family man. I take leisurely walks with my youngest son. On the other hand, running becomes a shared escapade with my eldest, as we challenge each other's limits. My wife and I share stories of our workday, while we lay on the sofa, at times with the TV on mute.
