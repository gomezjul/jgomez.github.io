      <h1>Questions:</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>What is your name? Adrian Gonzalez</li>
        <li>Do you have any nicknames? I started calling myself two-wheel, ha.</li>
        <li>Tell me about one of the best moments in your childhood. I didn&apos;t see it then but having a mom and dad who were always there and did as much as they could for us with the little we had.</li>
        <li>Can you tell me about the important people in your life? In my life, my family is the most important but that also includes my work family because I spend so much time with them and I have managed to get where I am today with their help.</li>
        <li>What is your favorite hobby? I enjoy being outside, mainly riding a bike, but overall just like being outdoors.</li>
        <li>What kind of pets do you have? Well, I can tell you that I would like to have 100&apos;s of pets! If you guessed an ant farm then you are right on the money because that&apos;s what I would like but my wife is afraid something will happen where they get out and bite our youngest son.</li>
        <li>What causes are you passionate about? I love to help people. This has become challenging though because you don&apos;t know who you can trust. Today we help people through my wife&apos;s work (she works for CPS).</li>
        <li>What is your highest level of education? A bachelors in accounting, I wanted to test for the CPA but time and money got in the way, mostly money.</li>
        <li>What have been some of the happiest moments in your life? Getting married, having kids and just watching movies or the stars with them.</li>
        <li>How did you and your family respond to Covid? We freaked out initially. No one knew what it was, how dangerous it could be. It showed how fragile life can be.</li>
